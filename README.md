# Model Car Database Analysis

A demonstration project showcasing typical sales analysis workflows for a small-scale auto dealer. You’ll learn how to design the database schema, seed it with realistic data, and run analytical queries to uncover sales trends, inventory status, and customer behavior.

## Motivation

Auto dealers need to track inventory, sales performance, and customer purchases. This project simulates a miniature dealership environment to practice SQL querying, data modeling, and reporting.

## Project Structure

- `schema.sql`: Defines tables (`Customers`, `Cars`, `Inventory`, `Sales`) and establishes relationships.  
- `sample_data.sql`: Inserts representative sample records to simulate transactions.  
- `analysis_queries.sql`: Contains example queries for reporting: sales by model, monthly trend analysis, inventory checks, top-spender identification, and low-stock alerts.  
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.  
- `LICENSE`: Contains the full MIT License text.

## Prerequisites

- **MySQL Server** (v8.0 or later)  
- **MySQL Workbench** (or any SQL client)  
- Sufficient user permissions to create schemas and tables.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.  
3. Create a new schema (e.g., `model_car_db`).  
4. Execute `schema.sql` to create tables.  
5. Execute `sample_data.sql` to populate tables.  
6. Run `analysis_queries.sql` to generate reports and inspect results.

## Example Output

![Sales Trend Chart](./docs/sales_trend.png)  
*(Sample line chart of monthly revenue generated by the analysis queries.)*

## Documentation & Visualization

The `docs/` folder includes:
- **Entity–Relationship Diagram** (`docs/er_diagram.png`): Visual map of table relationships.  
- **Data Dictionary** (`docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`): Detailed definitions for each table and column (data types, descriptions, constraints).  
- **Sample Query Outputs** (e.g., `docs/sales_trend.png`): Charts and screenshots illustrating key query results.

## Next Steps

- Integrate with a Python script (using `mysql-connector-python`) to automate report generation.  
- Build a BI dashboard (e.g., with Tableau, Power BI, or a web framework) for live monitoring.  
- Add more analytical queries: customer segmentation, year-over-year growth, profitability metrics.
